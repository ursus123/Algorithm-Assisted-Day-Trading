# Algorithm-Assisted-Day-Trading

## Project Summary
- In this project I intended to build a function/application that can help day traders (alongside other techniques) predict a future value of a stock
in order to decide whether they should sell or hold that stock.
- This function requires to input the value of shares' stock a person hold and the ticker of that stock and this function will output the future (the next day) predicted value of those shares and the function will advise the day trader whether to sell or hold.
- Before designing that function, I showed how to analyse a stock is performing in details using common methods such as moving averages, trend and seasonality...
- After that a model was developed using Long Short Time Memory Networks.

## Data Source
Stock data used in this project can be found in various platforms that offer financial data such as yahoo finance, google finance, Bloomberg, etc. For this project, yahoo finance was used because it is easy to import data (we donâ€™t need an API key) and it is commonly used among python (the programming language that was used)  users.

## Prerequisite
- Jupyter Notebook (Anaconda 3) (https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html)
- Commonly Used Libraries (Pandas, Numpy, Tensorflow Keras) for data manipulation and modeling
