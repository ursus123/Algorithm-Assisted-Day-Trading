# Algorithm-Assisted-Day-Trading
## Introduction
- In this project I intended to build a function/application that can help day traders (alongside other techniques)
in order to decide whether they should sell or hold a stock they already have.
- This function requires to input the value of shares' stock a person hold and the ticker of that stock and this function will output the future (the next day) predicted value of those shares
